Create a moon landing animation in a single self-contained HTML file (no external libs/assets). On load: lunar module descends, thrusters ignite and kick up heavy dust, then soft touchdown. Astronaut hops down, leaves footprints, and plants a US flag that waves subtly. Add stars + Earth in the sky. Click anywhere to replay; add a “Plant Flag” button to re-trigger the flag animation. Use canvas + requestAnimationFrame, simple shapes.
