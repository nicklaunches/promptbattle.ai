Create an interactive vintage theater popcorn machine in a single HTML file (no external libraries). Warm paper background (#f5f0e6), punchy orange (#ff6b35) accent, black ink outlines for retro-modern style. Yellow kernels shake then violently pop into fluffy white popcorn with burst effects, bouncing off glass walls and piling up. Steam particles rise, warming light pulses, occasional butter drizzle. Click machine to drop kernels, heat slider controls pop intensity, "Open Door" button spills popcorn onto floor, reset button clears all. Canvas-based with realistic gravity and bounce physics. Classic red/orange cinema popper with glass cabinet, metal frame, and subtle reflections.
