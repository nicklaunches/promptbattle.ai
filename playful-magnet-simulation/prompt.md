Build a playful magnet simulation: instantly show a magnet sliding in, then hundreds of tiny 'iron filings' rotate/align into field patterns around it. Drag the magnet with the mouse; filings smoothly re-orient. Add a 'Reverse polarity' button that flips the field. Warm "paper" base + punchy orange + black ink outlines = retro-modern. Single HTML file using canvas + requestAnimationFrame.
